# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Brief

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Completed Work

While creating this workday planner page I:

* Used moment.js and jquery to display the current day and date

* Created timeblocks ranging throughout the workday's standard hours

* Added a color code indicating the current time of the day using moment.js and jquery

* Created text areas in each time frame where you can store events

* Added proper functionality saving events on click of the save button and redisplaying the events on page reload

* Added some styling for desired appearance
